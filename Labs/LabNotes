//1. To start the Modelsim environment

source /CMC/ENVIRONMENT/modelsim.env

//Modelsim is used to simulate the code from VHDL

//Use vcom to compile the files
vcom [fileName]


//Use vsim to simulate the files without the .vhd which have been compiled
vsim [fileName] &

//Modelsim then opens
Click on one of the objects then ADD -> To Wave -> Signals in Region

//4. Then Create -- Load the DO File in the DO directory
vsim -do ../DO/[fileName].do &
//That's to see the simulation

//5. Precision to start Synthesis
source /CMC/ENVIRONMENT/fpga_advantage.env

//then run Precision
precision &

//Start new project from Precision, set location to FPGA_ADV
Add all Files to the project (the VHDL files)
//Setup Design
Select Xilinx -> VIRTEX-II PRO -> DEVICE 2VP3Off896
ADD Frequency
//Compile

//Synthesize
//RTL Schematics


//Start technology Mapping
//7 Open XIlinx
//Move to xilinx directory before 
source /CMC/ENVIRONMENT/xilinx.env

ise &

//Create new project in Xilinx
Top Level resource, select EDIF //Because that's what we got from Synthesis


//Selecting the Input Design file
Select the .EDF file from the directory which the project was previously run from Precision.

//Selecting the Constraint file
//The user constraint is initially empty.
The .UCF file should thus be written with this:

CONFIG STEPPING="0";
NET [name of inputs] LOC = [something];
NET [name of outputs] LOC = [something];

//Project finished in xilinx
Click on File, the .edf File
Double click on Inplement Design below;
Right Click on Generate Design -> Properties -> Clock JTAG CLK;  //IMPORTANT!!!
Then Generate the Programming File & Close


//Now loading the bit file 
//Run impact
impact&
//Create a new project
Select Prepare a System ACE File

Specify Collection name and location //Location is where the xilinx file was 

Select Configuration Address 0 only

Finish then  Add the .bit file;



//To be continued to run the file on the FPGA ...
