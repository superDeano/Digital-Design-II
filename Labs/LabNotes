/* 
* To start the Modelsim environment
*/
source /CMC/ENVIRONMENT/modelsim.env

//2. Use vcom to compile the files
vcom [fileName].vhd

//3. Use vsim to simulate the files without the .vhd which have been compiled
vsim [fileName] &

//Modelsim then opens
Click on one of the objects then ADD -> To Wave -> Signals in Region

//4. Then Create -- Load the DO File in the DO directory
vsim -do ../DO/[fileName].do &
//That's to see the simulation

/*
* To start Precision Environment
*/
//5. To start Precision 
source /CMC/ENVIRONMENT/fpga_advantage.env

//6. then run Precision
precision &

//7. Start new project from Precision, set location to FPGA_ADV
Add all Files to the project (the VHDL files)
//8. Setup Design
Select Xilinx -> VIRTEX-II PRO -> DEVICE 2VP3Off896
Set Frequency: 100.0 MHz
//9. Compile

//10. Synthesize
//RTL Schematics


/*
* To start Xilinx
*/
//11. Move to xilinx directory before 
source /CMC/ENVIRONMENT/xilinx.env

ise &

//13. Create new project in Xilinx
Top Level resource, select EDIF //Because that's what we got from Synthesis
//Precision created the .EDF and .UCF files

//14. Selecting the Input Design file
Select the .EDF file from the directory which the project was previously run from Precision.

//15. Selecting the Constraint file
The .UCF file should be written with this:

CONFIG STEPPING="0";
NET carry_in LOC = AC11;
NET input1 LOC = AD11;
NET input2 LOC = AF8;
NET carry_out_neg
LOC = AC4;
NET sum_out_neg LOC = AC3; 


//16. Select Next
specify the following:

Device Family: Virtex2P
Device: xc2vp30
Package: ff896
Speed Grade: -7
Top_level Module Type: EDIF
Simulator: Other VHDL

//17. Project finished in xilinx
Click on File, the .edf File
Double click on Inplement Design below;
Right Click on Generate Design -> Properties -> Clock JTAG CLK;  //IMPORTANT!!!
Then Generate the Programming File & Close


//Now loading the bit file 
/*
* To Start Impact
*/
//18. Run impact
impact&
//19. Create a new project
Select Prepare a System ACE File
Operating Mode - Novice

Specify Collection name and location //Location is where the xilinx file was 

Select Configuration Address 0 only

Then  Add the .bit file;
Generate File...
//20. Look for the [rev0.ace] file then put it on the sd card.
//To be continued to run the file on the FPGA ...
